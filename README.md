### Reason behind this project
This repository holds one of three parts of our Software Engineering course at our college. This time we're obliged to make an application that will help people of our Academy with organizing different events.
There are two more parts of this project:

* [Backend App](https://github.com/wtarsa/EventsOrganizerBackend)

* [Desktop App](https://github.com/Rados13/EventsOrganizerDesktop)

### How to install it?

2. Install all packages by typing npm install

Please, notice that in file that covers api, there's a basic link of http://localhost:8080 - it's only in development mode and for now, it doesn't really use any api.
